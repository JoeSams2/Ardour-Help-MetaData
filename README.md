From post by Paul Davis...
So, your task, oh lovely Ardouristas, is to add to this thread, as a list of lines that look something this:

“Display selection clock” : visible clock selection hide show display

i.e. some string corresponding (roughly) to what is visible in the GUI, followed by a list of (english) space separated keywords that you associate with that preference item.

The more metadata we get, the more searchable preferences will become, and the easier it will be for everyone to find relevant preferences. Thanks in advance for your help!


CSV's of Session properties and Preferences Metadata
Standard text csv - fields delimiter comma, text delimiter quote.
Open in spreadsheet, fill in Visible and metadata fields, save back in csv.
Make github Pull Request and I'll merge until project is complete.
